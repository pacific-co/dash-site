# Welcome to Human Design System
Human Design System is a humanist design system, as the name says. Made in Figma. I got bored of MD3 and San Francisco.

## Rules of using HDS
1. Always include color picker in user settings of your app or website. 
2. Follow the default color scheme. If you are designing it in Figma, use the official Human Design System components.
