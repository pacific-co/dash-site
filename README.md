## ðŸ§­ Philosophy

We believe great software doesnâ€™t overwhelm â€” it integrates.  
At Fiber, design is not an afterthought. It is the foundation.

Our core principles:

- **Clarity over complexity** â€” simplicity is scalable  
- **Speed with intention** â€” performance should never feel rushed  
- **Design as truth** â€” interfaces should be honest, helpful, and human
